<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/description/">438. Find All Anagrams in a String</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.</p>

<p>An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.</p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc", numRows = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> [0,6]
<strong>Explaination</strong> <p>The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".</p>
